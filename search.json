Giving without harming\nHelp without hurting?\nKimmerer / Ecological?\n\n11.0.1 Matthew 20: 20-28\n\n\n11.0.2 A Mother's Request\n20 Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him.\n21 \"What is it you want?\" he asked.\nShe said, \"Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.\"\n22 \"You don't know what you are asking,\" Jesus said to them. \"Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?\"\n\"We can,\" they answered.\n23 Jesus said to them, \"You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.\"\n24 When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. 25 Jesus called them together and said, \"You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. 26 Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 27 and whoever wants to be first must be your slave— 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\"\nIt's unsettling; not sure can explain it all. But the sense is that grasping for power and recognition is not the way of the kingdom; that it is completely on the wrong track. That our leader, our model, has the greatest power but (unlike most of this world) combines it with the greatest compassion; no entitlement, only service and generosity. Our role model shows us maybe the only way to have power without letting it corrupt.\nThis is not just theology. It is playing out in our lives every day.\nHelping, Fixing, or Serving?\nBY RACHEL NAOMI REMEN|\nhttps://www.lionsroar.com/helping-fixing-or-serving/\nHelping, fixing and serving represent three different ways of seeing life. When you help, you see life as weak. When you fix, you see life as broken. When you serve, you see life as whole. Fixing and helping may be the work of the ego, and service the work of the soul.\nServing is different from helping. Helping is not a relationship between equals. A helper may see others as weaker than they are, needier than they are, and people often feel this inequality. The danger in helping is that we may inadvertently take away from people more than we could ever give them; we may diminish their self-esteem, their sense of worth, integrity or even wholeness.\nWhen we help, we become aware of our own strength. But when we serve, we don't serve with our strength; we serve with ourselves, and we draw from all of our experiences. \nService is a relationship between equals: our service strengthens us as well as others.\nServing requires us to know that our humanity is more powerful than our expertise. In forty-five years of chronic illness I have been helped by a great number of people, and fixed by a great many others who did not recognize my wholeness. All that fixing and helping left me wounded in some important and fundamental ways. Only service heals."
