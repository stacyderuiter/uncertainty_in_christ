# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome! This is a collection of devotions and meditations for the
statistics classroom. It is a work in progress. (Currently, it's utterly
under construction; it's in the form of notes that will not make sense
to anyone but me! Please hold for updates later this summer...)

If you have questions or comments, please [reach
out.](https://calvin.edu/directory/people/stacy-l-de-ruiter "contact info for Stacy:")
